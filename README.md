# README: How to Run the Project
This README provides instructions on how to run the project locally on your computer. Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### `Node.js`
The project requires Node.js to run. You can download and install it from the official website.

### `npm (Node Package Manager)`
npm is usually included with Node.js installation. You can verify its presence by running npm -v in your terminal.

### `Git`
You need Git to clone the project repository. You can download and install it from the official website.

Now that you have the prerequisites, follow these steps to run the React project:

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command to clone the project repository:

### `git clone <repository-url>`
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the project repository.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change your current directory to the project directory by running:

### `cd <project-directory>`

Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory where the project was cloned.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
In the project directory, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command:

### `npm install`

This command will download and install all the necessary packages and libraries specified in the package.json file.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server
To run the development server and launch the React application, use the following command:

### `npm start`

This command will start the development server, and your default web browser should open to display the application. If it doesn't, you can manually open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified).
